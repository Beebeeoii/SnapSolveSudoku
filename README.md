Leveraging on Machine Learning using Tensorflow and personalised image processing algorithms with the use of OpenCV, Snap Solve Sudoku aims to be accurate in detecting and recognising sudoku boards and its digits. Regardless of image source, be it from desktop monitors or printed media, the app's accuracy has been overwhelming!
