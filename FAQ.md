## How do I improve the accuracy of detection?

---
Many factors affect the accuracy of detection, especially when it is a digital picture (picture of a computer screen, monitor etc). This is because of the digital noise that stems from interference when the camera is taking a snapshot.

Options to improve accuracy of detection of a **digital picture**:

  1) Before capturing the picture, adjust as much as possible to reduce noise seen in the camera preview
    - This is usually achieved when the board is as big as possible in the camera preview
  2) Screenshot the board and import via the gallery feature. This removes digital noise interference completely.

Options to improve accuracy of detection of a **normal picture**:

  1) Stabilise camera and allow it to auto-focus before snapping
  2) Adjust such that sudoku board fills most of the area in the camera preview
